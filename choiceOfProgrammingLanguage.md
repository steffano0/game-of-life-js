# Why did I choose JavaScript?

1. Animation capabilities: JavaScript has built-in capabilities for creating animations and dynamically updating the content of a web page without the need for external libraries. This allowed me to choose the initial state of the cells and visually display their evolution in an interactive way.

2. Easy integration into the browser: JavaScript can be directly integrated into the HTML code of a web page without requiring additional tools. This facilitates access to the game, as no additional software installation is required.

3. Powerful standard libraries: JavaScript has several built-in libraries that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as matrix manipulation and handling the behavior of the Document Object Model (DOM). This is very convenient for implementing the Game of Life.

4. Easy to troubleshoot: Since JavaScript is a widely used programming language, there is plenty of documentation and communities available to help with debugging.
